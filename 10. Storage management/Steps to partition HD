 Steps to Partitioning

a) Create disk
  - go to Vsphere in VMware to add a disk to partition
  - right click your VM--edit settings -- add hard disk ---new harddisk
  - go to new hard disk and select a size
  -disk provisioning *select thin provisioning****

b) #lsblk
run this command to see what is there so far.


c)Format disk on command line (use command fdisk to manipulate partition table)
#fdisk is a disk manipulator!!
-c (turns off DOS because we are not working with MSDOS)
-u (change size from cylinder)
#fdisk -cu /dev/sda
(flag -c = switching off DOS-compatible mode---- flag u= give size in sector, not cylinder)
(the /dev/sda, represents which HD to partition, sda=)

NPTL -"never poke the loser"

N- add new partition
p - primary
Skip the first sector--
+1G - to add gig to this partition and for the specific part you're using it for
t - to prompt change to the patitions system id (hexcode for a specific partition comes next)
1 - partition number
l - select l to see the list of different hexcodes
83 - the hexcode
optional - p (to view what you just did), - n to add a new partition  w- to save the partition
or q- to quit without making any changes

after saving use
#partprobe /dev/sdb   ---this makes the kernel recognize this partitions

run
#fdisk   or    #lsblk  to check it

now format the partition by giving it a file system (make sure to use the correct ext)
#mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1  --- this formatted the partition (linux partition)

make a mount point ..
1. make a dir under the root directory
#mkdir /newmount
2. mount it
#mount /dev/sdb1 /newmount
3. check it
#mount  ---this shows all mount points and your new one should be there

add it to the fstab..
MAKE A COPY OF THE FSTAB *** cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bk
1. #blkid   ----this gives the UUID for your partition,  copy it and paste it into the fstab
2. #vi /etc/fstab
3. not paste the UUID and format it to look like
UUID ....name of mount dir....ext4(type of FS)....defaults...11 or 12 or 00

Format the Swap   (swap partition)  ---swap doesn't get mounted like a FS does
#mkswap /dev/sdb2 -----(gives UUID of swap)
#swapon -a /dev/sdb2  (turns on the swap)
#blkid ... see UUID for swap, copy it
#vi /etc/fstab ...
add the new line for swap using the UUID for swap
ex: UUID .... sswap....swap.....default ....11

Format the LVM
#pvcreate /dev/sbd3    ---(command to create pv and the path to the partition)
#pvdisplay to see what you have created -------------there is also #pvremove
#vgcreate group1 /dev/sdb3   ----command, name new vol group, then pv (path to the partition)
#vgdisplay to see the group you just created

#lvcreate -L +2G -n lvname1  group1  /dev/sdb1
*L because not all the space is being used, you can specify how much
*l works in percentage, and can o
*n creates the lv name   (use -r  to implement now, on the fly)
*group1 --put the group the lvm is being pulled from
*path to the partition

Now format it
#mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/group1-lvname1 /dev/sdb2
*you must use /dev/mapper to format a lvm

Now mount it
#mkdir /lvmmount
#mount /dev/mapper/group1-lvname /dev/sdb2
#mount  --- to see the exchanges
#blkid  ----to get the UUID of the /dev/mapper
*****make sure you copy the UUID from the line that says /dev/mapper because this is the one for the lvm
#vi /etc/fstab
--add a line using the /dev/mapper UUID and edit it to look like the others (/dev/mapper does not NEED a UUID in fstab
you can use the dev/mapper absolute path)
ex :  UUID .../lvmount ....ext4 .....default .....11
**Modern SATA and USB drives are represented like sda, sdb etc. Linux stores every device in /dev directory.
**So, the absolute path for first SATA hard drive will be /dev/sda. The path to cdrom will be /dev/cdrom. The first partition will be represented as /dev/sda1, the second as /dev/sda2, and so on.





Reminder:
For LVM ----------------------------------------------
c) Create physical volume
d) Create volume groups
e) Logical volume
f) File system (better to create on LV vs Physical Volume)
g) Mount file system

For SWAP ---------------------------------------------
no need for pv, vg, lvm ...
make sure to turn swap on

For ROOT ---------------------------------------------


** make sure to get the UUID from the
#blkid
copy and past the UUID into the /ect/fstab and write out the rest of the information using the other lines
in fstab

the way disk can be split
-make sure to leave space for overhead
-LVM should get majority
-Swap should be on every partition


If you
#mount -o remount,rw /
