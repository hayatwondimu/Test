1. Setup yum repository to point to http://10.1.10.20/CentOS-6

# cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
# vim name.repo   --> give it name
[Base]
name=
baseurl=
enabled=1
gpgcheck=no

After adding the contents above into the repo file, you can save it
Run
#yum cleanall (afterwards to clean the cache)(clears out the memory for yum or you will use the old repo)
Run
#yum repolist (to build the repository)

2. Create a directory ~/etcbackup and copy all *.conf files from /etc into it make sure you include all subdirectories of /etc. and rename all *.conf files to *.backup.

[root@hayat ~]
# mkdir ~/etcbackup         --> (made directory)
#cp /etc/*.conf ~/etcbackup/    --->copy the info from /etc/ and *(wildcard).conf means everything that has ext .conf over to the new dir ~/etcbackup/
#cp -var /etc/*.conf ~/etcbackup    (flags=verbose, archive, recursive) (shows you what was just copied over)
#rename .conf .backup *.conf    ---> this renamed all files that ended with .conf to .backup

3. Find all files created after January 31st 2018 and copy them to ~/backup2018
###find /(under the root) -type(what type, f or d) f(file but d for directory) -newerm(modify)t(time) '01/31/2019' -exec (execute previous and also what comes next) cp {} (variables)
#find . -type f -newermt '01/31/2019' -exec cp {} ~ /backup2018 \;

4. Create a hard link to ~/backup2018 named hdlbackup2018
Create a soft link to ~/backup named sftletcbackup
Set attribute on ~/backup2018etc


ln (link) -s ( the -s makes it a soft link) (without -s it's a hard link)
#ln -s ~/backup2018/ hdlbackup2018      --> makes a soft link connecting the info from backup2018 to hdlbackup2018

#touch ~/backup2018etc

#chattr +i backup2018etc    --> this added an sticky bit/ attribute which restricts the actions for those outside of root
#lsattr backup2018etc       --> this will show the attribute has been added

#touch sftletcbackup
#ln ~/backup sftletcbackup
#mkdir ~/backup
#touch backups
#ln ~/backups sftletcbackup
