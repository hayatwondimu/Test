extensions ex
.exe (means it is an application that has been downloaded, .exe is one example)
in linux .rpm shows that it is a software that has been downloaded (using yum or rpm)
rpm --> redhat package manager


wget command... and use link to download
curl command ...and use link to download
ansible ... quicker way to make changes for groups instead of one by one
echo

cd ../dir (going back enough to go forward)


soft links and hard links (quicker access)   can't do a soft link to a directory,
hard link is file to file (changes made in one file mirrors the other)
soft link is directory to directory

soft link -->   #ln -s Source Destination
Modern SATA and USB drives are represented like sda, sdb etc. Linux stores every device
in /dev directory. So, the absolute path for first SATA hard drive will be /dev/sda.
The path to cdrom will be /dev/cdrom. The first partition will be represented as /dev/sda1, the second as /dev/sda2, and so on.

#mount -rw
#mount -o
remove partion from Command lines- the vi into fstab and  should not have the UID (dev ID)
fdisk -l
/etc/fstab (where all UID for devices are)
to remove partition
1. umount
2. vi to /etc/fstab ....remov UID of the partition you want to remove (IF THIS STEP IS SKIPPED, SYSTEM will CRASH)
fdisk -cu /dev/sda1
m (to list and find command)..... hit d for delete ,
it will ask which partition from that HD

fdisk -L  /dev/sdb

BlkID /dev/sda  --- will give you the UID of the partition

if you cant ssh into machine, ping your ip first
if no return,
go to the vmware, into terminal and run
#ifconfig
trouble shoot the network
#system-config-networksthis opens the networks
(change the incorrect information, ex edit the subnet to 255.255.0.0)
then Run
#service network restart

go back to putty and Run
#ping 10.1.11.99
