IP (short for Internet Protocol) specifies the technical format of packets and the addressing scheme for computers to communicate
over a network. Most networks combine IP with a higher-level protocol called Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which establishes
a virtual connection between a destination and a source.
IP by itself can be compared to something like the postal system. It allows you to address a package and drop it in the system,
but there's no direct link between you and the recipient. TCP/IP, on the other hand, establishes a connection between two hosts
so that they can send messages back and forth for a period of time.

Internet protocol versions ----- currently only 2 versions, IPV4 and IPV6
IPV4
IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4) is the fourth revision of the Internet Protocol (IP) used to to identify devices on a network
through an addressing system. The Internet Protocol is designed for use in interconnected systems of packet-switched computer
communication networks (see RFC:791).

IPv4 is the most widely deployed Internet protocol used to connect devices to the Internet. IPv4 uses a 32-bit address scheme allowing
for a total of 2^32 addresses (just over 4 billion addresses).  With the growth of the Internet it is expected that the number of
unused IPv4 addresses will eventually run out because every device -- including computers, smartphones and game consoles -- that
connects to the Internet requires an address.
