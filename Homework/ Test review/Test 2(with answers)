mkdir -p /test1/test2/test3/test4
10.  Directories test2’s group owner should be Dev and test3 group owner should be ops
chown :Dev test1/test2
  OR
chgrp Dev test1/test2

chown :Ops test1/test2/test3
OR
chgrp Ops test1/test2
11.  Using rsync, copy the test2 file located on server 10.1.11.124 under /tmp/ to Jerry’s and Steve’s home dir.
rsync server@10.1.11.124:/tmp/test2 /Jtest/home
rsync server@10.1.11.124:/tmp/test2    /Sdoe/home
12.  From that file, export all lines with the word selinux to a new file in test2 named selinux.txt

Ans: grep -i selinux >> /test1/test2/selinux.txt

 grep -i sata test2 >> /test1/test2/test3/sata.txt

chown hwondimu: test1
chown hwondimu: test1/test2/test3/test4
chown hwondimu: test1/test2/test3/test4/test5
15.  Test 2, should have the user owner as Jerry and Steve should be the user owner of test3.
chown Jtest:  test1/test2
chown Sdoe: /test1/test2/test3
16.  The file in the test2 dir should have rwx, for user, rwx, for group and r for others
chmod 774 /test1/test2
17.   The file in test3 should have rwx,
