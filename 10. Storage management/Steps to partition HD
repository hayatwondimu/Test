Steps to Partitioning

a) Create disk
  - go to Vsphere in VMware to add a disk to partition
  - right click your VM--edit settings -- add hard disk ---new harddisk
  - go to new hard disk and select a size
b) Format disk on command line (use command fdisk to manipulate partition table)
#fdisk -cu /dev/sda
(flag -c = switching off DOS-compatible mode---- flag u= give size in sector, not cylinder)
(the /dev/sda, represents which HD to partition, sda=)
**Modern SATA and USB drives are represented like sda, sdb etc. Linux stores every device in /dev directory.
**So, the absolute path for first SATA hard drive will be /dev/sda. The path to cdrom will be /dev/cdrom. The first partition will be represented as /dev/sda1, the second as /dev/sda2, and so on.


c) Create physical volume
d) Create volume groups
e) Logical volume
f) File system (better to create on LV vs Physical Volume)
g) Mount file system
