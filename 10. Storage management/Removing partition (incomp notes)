remove partion from Command lines- the vi into fstab and  should not have the UID (dev ID)
fdisk -l
/etc/fstab (where all UID for devices are)
to remove partition
1. umount
2. vi to /etc/fstab ....remov UID of the partition you want to remove (IF THIS STEP IS SKIPPED, SYSTEM will CRASH)
fdisk -cu /dev/sda1
m (to list and find command)..... hit d for delete ,
it will ask which partition from that HD

fdisk -L  /dev/sdb

BlkID /dev/sda  --- will give you the UID of the partition


*** make sure when removing a HD that the fstab
in  /etc/fstab should be unmounted of the partitions from that HD

unmounted
unmount the dev/mapper
/remove from /etc/fstab
#vgremove
