FTP- File transfer protocol (not secure/ encrypted)
- a standard protocol that is used to transfer file between computers + servers over a network
-FTP is the language the comp use to transfer files over a TCP/IP networks
    -Server (person 1) can make their files available for other people to download by uploading
    their files to the FTP server + then clients (others) can connect to the FTP server + download the files using the FTP protocol
    The server doesn't have to set up a designated FTP server to do this b/c they can configure their own computer to act as an FTP server
Ways to transfer files using FTP
  1. use the internet browser (standard)
        - you would need to put "ftp://10.1.13.5"
          *ftp = prefix for FTP
          *the whole line is the ftp servers address
  2. FTP client
        - There are multiple FTP client (services?), the most popular is "filezila" which can be downloaded for free
          *Host--> ftp://10.1.13.5      username:exhayat_ntp        password:mts1234

-FTP and SFTP are connection oriented protocols, they both use TCP for file transfer which guaranteed delivery.

Why FTP uses 2 TCP connection ports
- Port 21 : Control connection -> to pass control info / conttrol traffic. The FTP server will listen for client connections on this port,
client sends authentications to be approved in order to have access to the data
- Port 22 : Data connection -> to send files between the client and the server since connection has been established with port 21 after client sent authentication at port 21.

VSFTPD - Very secure file transfer protocol daemon
- VSFTPD is the default FTP server and one of the few FTP service that can chroot jail.

*To install vsftdp
#yum install vsftpd

*to edit the configuration file
#vi /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.config  (will chroot by default)

SFTP- Secure file transfer protocol
SFTP is similar to FTP but has a layer of security + the information is encrypted and secure, data is encrypted using secure shell
-Authenticates the user and the server
-Uses port 22
-Connection oriented protocol, uses TCP for file transfer which guaranty file delivery

TFTP - Trivial file transfer protocols-very simple transfer protocol
-very simple transfer protocol
-not used to transfer file over the internet like FTP SFTP. Mainly used to transfer files with in the Local area network.
Ex:- Usually used to transfer configuration files and firm wave images to network devices such as firewalls and routers.
-TFTP is a connection less protocol that uses UDP instead of TCP and it not as frequently used like FTP and SFTP
-No security during data transfer
