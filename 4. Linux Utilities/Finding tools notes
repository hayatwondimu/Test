To copy lines that only have specific word(s) in it and paste that info into a new file
#grep -i word /home/hayat/tmp/example >> /home/hayat/testdir
this line searched for the word "word" (-i = not case sensitive in search) within the file example (in tmp)
and appended all lines with the word "word" into the file testdir in the home of hayat --> /home/hayat/testdir
it created a file called testdir, it can only paste in file not a directory)
